<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![codegambit Screen Shot]][product-screenshot]

`codegambit` is web app aimed to get users used to entering commands and scripting in the context of playing chess. Play a game against a bot or complete puzzles by writing scripts that execute multiple moves to solve the problem.



### Built With

This project is built with primarily TypeScript at the moment. I used React for the frontend design and functionality along with Redux to maintain the game state.

### Coming Up

The user management system was implemented with the help of PocketBase. This will allow for game/puzzle tracking and opens the door for multiplayer games. I aim to create a Go backend to maintain multiplayer game lobbies using websockets. For faster load times, and other benefits of server side rendering, I also want to migrate to Next.JS.
