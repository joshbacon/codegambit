<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![codegambit Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://codegambit.io)

`codegambit` is web app aimed to get users used to entering commands and writing simple functions in the context of playing chess. Play a game against a bot or a friend by entering commands into a terminal. You can also complete puzzles and lessons by writing scripts that execute multiple moves to solve the problem.



### Built With

This project is built with primarily JavaScript at the moment. I used React for the frontend design and functionality along with Redux to maintain the game state.

### Coming Up

I aim to create a user management system with the help of Clerk. This will allow for game/puzzle/lesson tracking and opens the door for multiplayer games. Go will be used to create a backend to maintain multiplayer game lobbies. For faster load times, and other benefits of server side rendering, I also want to migrate to Next.JS.
